# How to write good changelogs 

## What should changelogs include?

Changelogs should include a reverse-chronologically ordered list of changes you make to your open source project. The structure of a changelog can vary from project to project, but at bare minimum, they contain the following sections:

* Added: for new features
* Changed: for changes in any existing functionality 
* Fixed: for any bug fixes

Changelogs can also include other information, such as:

* Highlights
* Any deprecated features
* Resolved security vulnerabilities
* Previously supported integrations 
* Breaking changes
* Migrations

As you build your changelog, you'll need to decide what sections your changelog must have. If you're in the early stages of working on your open source project, you might need an "added", "changed", and "fixed" section to start. As your project evolves, you can add other sections, like "deprecated" or "migrations."
