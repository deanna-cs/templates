# How to write good changelogs 

Writing a good changelog starts with identifying your audience. You may need to create a changelog for an internal audience, like project stakeholders or engineering staff members. Alternatively, you might need a changelog for an external audience, like customers involved with testing your product or end users. Before you create your changelog, you must think about who your audience is and what their needs are. 

But you must remember the one thing both audiences have in common: they both want to know *what's* changed, *why* it changed, and *how* the changes impacts them. The content you include in your changelog can help them find that information.

## What should changelogs include?

Changelogs should include a reverse-chronologically ordered list of changes you make to your software project. The structure of a changelog can vary from project to project, but at bare minimum, they contain the following sections:

* Added: for new features
* Changed: for changes in any existing functionality 
* Fixed: for any bug fixes

Changelogs can also include other information, such as:

* Highlights
* Any deprecated features
* Resolved security vulnerabilities
* Previously supported integrations 
* Breaking changes
* Migrations

As you build your changelog, you'll need to decide what sections your changelog must have. If you're in the early stages of working on your software project, you might need an "added", "changed", and "fixed" section to start. As your project evolves, you can add other sections, like "deprecated" or "migrations."
